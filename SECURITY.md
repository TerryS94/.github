# Security Policy

I take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately using one of the methods below.

Preferred/fastest method of contact:
- Discord: asdasd#6168

Include as much detail as possible:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Affected versions, commits, or configurations
- Any potential impact you have identified

Minimal repro > long explanations.

## Response Timeline

I aim to respond to security reports within **12 hours**.

Depending on severity and availability, fixes may take longer. I will keep you informed once the issue is confirmed.

---

## Disclosure Policy

Please allow reasonable time for investigation and a fix before public disclosure.

Once a fix is released, coordinated disclosure is welcome and credit will be given where appropriate.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- Code and binaries in this repository
- Build scripts, tooling, and CI configurations

This policy does **not** apply to:
- Third-party dependencies (report those to the upstream project)
- Misconfigurations outside the repo or user environment issues

## Safe Harbor

If you:
- Act in good faith
- Avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service disruption
- Follow this disclosure policy

I will not pursue or support legal action related to your report.
